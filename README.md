# The Dining Philosophers
This application implements the well known "The Dining Philosophers Problem" where the algorithm ensures that no philosopher will starve; each philosopher can continue forever to swap between thinking and eating; no philosopher will know what others might do; and all these by avoiding the deadlock.

The aim of this exercise was to explore and understand the issues related to synchronisation in concurrent processes, especially the deadlock and resource contention in modern software development.

## Launching
To run the application, please compile and execute the "DiningPhilosophers.java" file.
