# Dining Philosophers
This application implements the well known "dining philosophers problem" where the algorithm ensures that no philosopher will starve; each philosopher can continue forever to swap between thinking and eating; no philosopher will know what others might do; and all these by avoiding the deadlock.

## Launch
To run the application, compile and execute the "DiningPhilosophers.java" file.
